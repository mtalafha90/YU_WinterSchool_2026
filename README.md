# YU_WinterSchool_2026
Hands-on Jupyter notebooks for an undergraduate winter school on space measurements of the Sun. The materials cover solar magnetic field observations, instrument effects and measurement bias, and simple time-series models of the solar cycle using lightweight, physics-based simulations.

This repository hosts the teaching materials for an undergraduate winter school module on space measurements and solar physics. The focus is on understanding how spacecraft measure physical quantities, how instrumental and geometric effects influence observations, and how simplified numerical models help bridge the gap between measurements and physical interpretation.

## Contents
- **Notebook 1:** Space Measurements of the Sun – from observations to simple simulations  
- **Notebook 2:** Instrument Effects & Measurement Bias in Space Physics  
- **Notebook 3:** Solar Cycle Basics Through Simple Time-Series Modeling  

## Learning Goals
- Understand the difference between measured and inferred quantities in space physics  
- Explore instrument effects such as projection, noise, resolution, and coverage  
- Build simple numerical models of solar magnetic fields and solar-cycle variability  
- Interpret time-series data in the context of space measurements  

## Requirements
Python 3.8+ with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook (see `requirements.txt`).
